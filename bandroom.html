There are multiple rooms to hide in. the best room would be the room when you come in all the way on the far left. There is a space between two rows of cubbies, in the corner. You slide into it and wait until Ms. Wiley leaves. You sigh in relief and walk out, only to hear the beginning of a oboe lesson. Their playing is so horrible that it bursts your ears and you slump to the floor, dead.

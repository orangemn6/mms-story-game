    You sprint out and try to run to room 129. You can't see if anyone's there, but you can't hear anything.
    You walk slower with the realization no one can see you. The darkness is complete. You can feel it â€” 
    walking down the back of your neck, surrounding you, consuming you. You stop to collect yourself.
    You've never seen the school like this. Of course you can't see it at all, but it feels different.
    None of the merriment (or lack thereof) and life that usually fills these halls. It feels empty. 
    You pull out your phone to use as a flashlight.

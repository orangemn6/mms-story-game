    You walk into the courtyard, but you already see swarms of people crowding it. You try to look for the homework pass, but when you pick up your map to look if this was the right place, students mistake it for the homework pass and all jump onto your hands. 

    <br>

    A teacher comes out in the midst of the chaos, looks at you thinking you were fighting them because of your broken hand and sends you to detention.

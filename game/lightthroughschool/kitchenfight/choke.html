            the hand tightens around your throat, farther and farther. you aren't thinking about the homework pass anymore — such superficial matters seem rather irrelevant to you now. your family is back at your house. your parents are working from home today. your grandparents came here to visit. they won't know you're gone, will they? not for a while. maybe they'll be happier without you. did they like you? did they love you? you'll never know now. did your friends love you? were they just around you out of pity? or for their own gain? do you really know anyone? you'll be gone, and you will never know. if only you had done things a bit differently in your life. the darkness seems more calm now. it's unlike anything you've ever seen. it's not foreboding, per se — rather, it's almost comforting. when you're gone, you'll simply be gone. your friends may suffer and die, but what does it matter to you? you've definitely lived one of the lives of all time. no one will remember you, of course. you haven't done anything, have you? you're pointless. if only you died a bit later. but it's not like you can go back and change your life. <br> <br>

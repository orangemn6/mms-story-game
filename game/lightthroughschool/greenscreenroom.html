<h1>You hop into the greenscreen room. You see someone coming, so you rush into the adjacent electical room.
    You look concerned at the mess of wires in front of you. You work to remain silent, but you feel a cough coming on.
    It's so powerful and enourmous ðŸ˜‰ that you're propelled backward, slam into the door, and subsequently fall foward,
    dislodging a cable. With a terrifying buzz, you feel each and every light in the building flicker out.

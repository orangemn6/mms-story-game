<h1>You hop into the green screen room. You see someone coming, so you rush into the adjacent electrical room.
    You look concerned at the mess of wires in front of you. You work to remain silent, but you feel a cough coming on.
    It's so powerful and enormous ðŸ˜‰ that you're propelled backward, slam into the door, and subsequently fall forward,
    dislodging a cable. With a terrifying buzz, you feel each and every light in the building flicker out.

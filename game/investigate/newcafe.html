<h1>You run past the gym class and into the new cafeteria, but you see a class inside. Mr. Oppel is teaching, but he's in a bad mood today because someone made a speech about why Mao Zedong and Communism and Social Credits are so good. 

When you are about to talk to him, you accidently knock over one of the poems he was grading, and you say "my bad".

He responds "yeah, your bad".

You instantly die from being roasted that much. </h1>

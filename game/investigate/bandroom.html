<h1>There are multiple rooms to hide in â€” the best room would be the room on the far left. 
In a corner, there is a space between two rows of cubbies. You slide into it and wait until Ms. Wiley leaves. 
You sigh in relief and walk out, only to hear the beginning of a oboe lesson. 
Their playing is so horrible that it bursts your ears and you slump to the floor, dead.</h1>
